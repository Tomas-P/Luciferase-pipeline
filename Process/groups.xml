	<!--Every group element follows the same simple pattern.
	There is a number element, which is unique to each group.
	It is not used yet, but it probably will be used for ID purpouses
	later. Then it has the lower element. The lower element marks the index
	of the first ROI in the group in the RoiSet.zip file used to identify plants.
	The higher element marks the index of the last ROI in the group in the
	RoiSet.zip file used to identify plants. The bounds should not overlap -->
