# Luciferase-pipeline
A repository to store my work on an automated pipeline for analyzing luciferase imaging data using Python and ImageJ

The pipeline processes, measures, and graphs data from luciferase images with minimal user input,
while maintaining the option to manually edit or define regions of interest and region of interest groups.

Pipeline strengths:
* all parameters passed at the beginning of the program, requiring minimal to no user input 
* Accurately, precicely, and reproducably produces graphs
* Fast
