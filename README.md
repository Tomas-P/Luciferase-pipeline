# Luciferase-pipeline
A repository to store my work on an automated pipeline for analyzing luciferase imaging data using Python and ImageJ.
The python files can go anywhere, but may need to update information on where Imagej lives. 
The macro file (the one ending with the .ijm extension) needs to go in the ImageJ folder, under plugins/Macros/.
