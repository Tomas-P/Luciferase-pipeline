	<!-- This file stores important information for running the pipeline.
	All elements are either a folder or a filename.
	Forward slashes are used for a few reasons. First, the pipeline is written
	to run on Linux. Second, backslashes have special meaning in Python. 
	Third, Python can use forward slashes to specify a filename or folder.
	Note that filenames will end in an extension, but foldernames will end 
	in a forward slash.-->
